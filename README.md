# Introduction 
As road incidents predominantly arise from driver behavior, presenting a notable safety hazard, it is crucial to improve situational awareness and minimize accidents.

# Solution
Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication’s ability to wirelessly exchange information about the speed and position of surrounding vehicles shows great promise in helping to avoid crashes, ease traffic congestion, and improve the environment. But the greatest benefits can only be achieved when all vehicles can communicate with each other. That’s why NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) has been working with the automotive industry and academic institutions for more than a decade to advance V2V communication's lifesaving potential into reality.
