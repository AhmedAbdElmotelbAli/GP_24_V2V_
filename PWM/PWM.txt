we have two modul in PWM first
M0PWM, M1PWM
each have  PWM 0-7
has two clock 
1-enable clock to PORT
2-Enable System Clock Divisor function
PWM mode 
1 count up
2 count down

1. Enable the PWM clock by writing a value of 0x0010.0000 to the RCGC0 register in the System
Control module
2. Enable the clock to the appropriate GPIO module via the RCGC2 register in the System Control
module
3. In the GPIO module, enable the appropriate pins for their alternate function using the
GPIOAFSEL register. To determine which GPIOs to configure
4. Configure the PMCn fields in the GPIOPCTL register to assign the PWM signals to the appropriate
pins 
5. Configure the Run-Mode Clock Configuration (RCC) register in the System Control module
to use the PWM divide (USEPWMDIV) and set the divider (PWMDIV) to divide by 2 (000).
6. Configure the PWM generator for countdown mode with immediate updates to the parameters.
■ Write the PWM0CTL register with a value of 0x0000.0000.
■ Write the PWM0GENA register with a value of 0x0000.008C.
■ Write the PWM0GENB register with a value of 0x0000.080C.
7. Set the period. For a 25-KHz frequency, the period = 1/25,000, or 40 microseconds. The PWM
clock source is 10 MHz; the system clock divided by 2. Thus there are 400 clock ticks per period
Use this value to set the PWM0LOAD register. In Count-Down mode, set the LOAD field in the
PWM0LOAD register to the requested period minus one.
■ Write the PWM0LOAD register with a value of 0x0000.018F.
8. Set the pulse width of the MnPWM0 pin for a 25% duty cycle.
■ Write the PWM0CMPA register with a value of 0x0000.012B.
9. Set the pulse width of the MnPWM1 pin for a 75% duty cycle.
■ Write the PWM0CMPB register with a value of 0x0000.0063.
10. Start the timers in PWM generator 0.
■ Write the PWM0CTL register with a value of 0x0000.0001.
11. Enable PWM outputs.
■ Write the PWMENABLE register with a value of 0x0000.0003.
